Pre-increment (++x):
Increments the value of x before it is used in the expression.
If x is 5, then ++x will make x 6 and use the value 6 in the expression.
int x = 5;
int y = ++x; Here,x is incremented to 6, then y is assigned the value of 6.
Output: x = 6, y = 6

Post-increment (x++):
Uses the current value of x in the expression, then increments x.
If x is 5, then x++ will use the value 5 in the expression and then make x 6.
int x = 5;
int y = x++; Here, y is assigned the value of 5, then x is incremented to 6.
Output: x = 6, y = 5

    // Objective:
    // The objective of the above code is to determine whether a given year is a leap year or not.

    // A leap year is defined by the following rules:
    // A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4.
    // However, if the year is also divisible by 100, it is not a leap year.
    // Nevertheless, if the year is also divisible by 400, it is a leap year.

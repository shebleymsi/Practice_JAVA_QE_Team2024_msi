//The do/while loop is a variant of the while loop.
//This loop will execute the code block once, before checking if the condition is true, then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true.
//The loop will always be executed at least once, even if the condition is false, because the code block is executed before the condition is tested:
//Do not forget to increase the variable used in the condition, otherwise the loop will never end!

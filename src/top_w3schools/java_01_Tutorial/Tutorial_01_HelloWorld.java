//The name of the java file must match the class name.

//Any code inside the main() method will be executed.
//just remember that every Java program has a class name which must match the filename,
//and that every program must contain the main() method.
//The curly braces {} marks the beginning and the end of a block of code.
//System is a built-in Java class that contains useful members, such as out, which is short for "output".
//The println() method, short for "print line", is used to print a value to the screen (or a file).
//each code statement must end with a semicolon (;)

//Primitive types in Java are predefined and built into the language, while non-primitive types are created by the programmer (except for String).
//Non-primitive types can be used to call methods to perform certain operations, wheras primitive types cannot.
//Primitive types start with a lowercase letter (like int), while non-primitive types typically starts with an uppercase letter (like String).
//Primitive types always hold a value, wheras non-primitive types can be null.

//Java counts positions from zero.
//0 is the first position in a string, 1 is the second, 2 is the third ...


//Java Variables continue ...

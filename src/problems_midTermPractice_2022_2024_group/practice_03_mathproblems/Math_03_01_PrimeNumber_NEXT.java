    *To find the list of prime numbers from 2 to 1 million efficiently,
    *you can use the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm,
    *which is known for its efficiency in finding all prime numbers up to a given limit.
    *This algorithm has a time complexity of 𝑂(𝑛log⁡log⁡𝑛)O(nloglogn),
    *making it very suitable for this task.
